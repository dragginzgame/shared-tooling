# Cargo dependency ownership

These rules are part of the mandatory [engineering baseline](../DRAGGINZGAME.md).
The repository's root `Cargo.toml` is the authoritative catalog of direct
dependencies and their version/source selections.
The [workspace layout rules](rust-workspaces.md) require a virtual root with
maintained packages under `crates/` and define independently scoped exceptions.
The [pinning rules](dependency-pinning.md) define compatible ranges, justified
exact constraints, immutable Git revisions, lockfiles and external path inputs.

## Required inheritance

- Declare every direct dependency in the root `[workspace.dependencies]`, even
  if only one child crate uses it. This includes third-party packages, local
  workspace crates, development dependencies, build dependencies and dependencies
  used only on particular targets or behind optional features.
- Every child `Cargo.toml` must reference that declaration with
  `name.workspace = true` or `name = { workspace = true, ... }`. Apply this to
  `[dependencies]`, `[dev-dependencies]`, `[build-dependencies]` and all of their
  target-specific forms. If an explicitly approved layout exception retains a
  root package, its dependency tables also inherit from the catalog rather than
  duplicating version/source selections.
- Versions, registry choices, local paths, Git URLs/revisions/branches/tags and
  renamed-package identities belong only in the root catalog. Child dependency
  declarations must not repeat or override them. Declare dependency aliases in
  the catalog too; do not use an alias to hide a drifting child version.
- Children retain their target conditions, optionality and needed features.
  Keep `optional` in the child, since Cargo does not permit it in
  `[workspace.dependencies]`. Preserve effective feature/default-feature behavior
  for the supported Cargo versions when centralizing declarations; inheritance
  must not silently enable features or raise MSRV.
- Excluded packages, examples, integration harnesses and nested workspaces are
  not implicit exemptions. An independently scoped child workspace requires a
  maintainer-approved exception naming its authoritative root, scope and reason;
  record it in the local overlay so dependency ownership remains visible.
- Add or update the root catalog and affected inherited uses in the same batch.
  During manifest review, inspect every child dependency table, including target,
  development and build tables, for standalone version/source declarations.
  Preserve the selected lockfile dependencies and build/publication behavior;
  centralization alone does not authorize dependency upgrades or release changes.
- Keep root and child manifests ordered with `cargo sort --workspace` under the
  [shared formatting contract](git-hooks.md). Include manifest sorting in both
  automatic pre-commit formatting and independent CI/release checks; ordering
  must preserve the catalog and every inherited selection.

## Preparing authorized dependency changes

- For an authorized version, source or feature change, trace every affected
  independent workspace graph, including examples, probes and test harnesses
  reached through path dependencies. A root library and an independent
  `testing/` workspace that depends on it can both need lockfile updates even
  when only the root library's dependency declaration changed.
- Prepare every affected lockfile in the same change batch using the narrowest
  authorized dependency operation. Preserve unrelated selections and local
  command-authority exceptions. Independent graphs must satisfy their declared
  contracts; compatible requirements need not resolve to identical versions.
  This does not collapse approved workspace boundaries or authorize an otherwise
  unrequested dependency upgrade.
- Before declaring dependency preparation complete, run each affected graph's
  owning cheap locked metadata check, including both root and `testing/` checks
  in the example above. Prepare selected caches explicitly when required and
  report any unavailable evidence. Metadata checks establish graph consistency,
  not build, test or native-host qualification; a full gate is not required just
  to prepare a dependency change.
- Keep ordinary release cache fetching locked. Reconcile manifest/lockfile
  mismatches during the authorized dependency change, before the pre-bump
  validation gate. Never silently unlock, upgrade or automatically repair
  dependencies during release. Preserve the complete consumer gate and its
  existing phase order.

## Example

Root `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[workspace.dependencies]
serde = "1"
tempfile = "3"
cc = "1"
rustix = { version = "1", features = ["fs"] }
```

Child `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { workspace = true, features = ["derive"] }

[dev-dependencies]
tempfile.workspace = true

[build-dependencies]
cc.workspace = true

[target.'cfg(unix)'.dependencies]
rustix.workspace = true
```

The root lists the complete direct dependency catalog; each child declares which
entries it uses. Cargo's supported inheritance and feature rules are documented
in [the Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#inheriting-a-dependency-from-a-workspace).
