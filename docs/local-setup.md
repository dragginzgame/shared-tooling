# Local developer setup

From the checkout root, prepare the common executables explicitly:

```bash
make install-tools
make tools-check
export PATH="$PWD/.tools/host/bin:$PWD/.tools/ic/bin:$PATH"
```

The Makefile uses those local paths automatically. Interactive shells need the
export above; setup does not edit shell profiles. Installation downloads tools;
checks are offline and never install missing dependencies. `install-tools` runs
host setup followed by IC setup, stopping on failure. Each set activates
independently: a later IC failure leaves the successfully installed host set.

`make install-host-tools` installs jq, **Mike Farah yq** (including its TOML
parser), and ripgrep with PCRE2 under `.tools/host/bin`. `make host-tools-check`
verifies their bytes before executing version and feature checks. The reviewed selections
live in [ci/tool-versions.env](../ci/tool-versions.env):
[jq 1.8.2](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases/tag/jq-1.8.2) and
[yq 4.47.2](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/tag/v4.47.2), and
[ripgrep 15.2.0](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/tag/15.2.0).
Setup itself needs neither parser installed. Distribution packages named `yq`
may provide a different implementation; they do not replace the selected parser.

Host setup downloads official native binaries for Linux x86-64/ARM64 and macOS
Intel/Apple Silicon, checks their pinned SHA-256 values and exact versions, and
atomically activates the selected set. Previous sets and failed candidates
remain under `.tools/host-set.*`. A lock prevents simultaneous installations;
inspect `.tools/.host-tools.lock/owner` and confirm its process has stopped before
removing an abandoned lock. Cleanup remains explicit. The `--versions` option
selects a reviewed shell file, which is executable code like a Makefile.

The shared installer's `--with-ripgrep` flag adds ripgrep explicitly; without it,
the existing jq/yq interface needs no additional pins. Shared Tooling's Make and
CI callers select the flag. Consumers adopting it add `SHARED_TOOLING_RIPGREP_VERSION`
and the four `SHARED_TOOLING_RIPGREP_SHA256_*` archive digests to their reviewed
versions file, and pass the flag to both installation and offline verification.
Offline checks authenticate the retained archive and compare its executable
bytes with installed `rg` before running it. They require the exact version
(allowing the official revision annotation) and a successful `--pcre2-version`.
No Cargo installation, global PATH change or system-package replacement occurs.

The [IC set](ic-tools.md) supplies Quill, ICP CLI, didc, ic-wasm, PocketIC and
wasm-opt. dfx is excluded. Linux ARM64 supports the host set only; the full IC
set lacks a matching Quill asset. Native CI qualifies both sets on Linux x86-64
and both macOS architectures; mapping Linux ARM64 is not native qualification.

## Bootstrap prerequisites

Use the host package manager for the shell, Git, GNU Make, curl, archive tools,
Perl and ordinary utilities. For Linux Mint/Ubuntu, the following explicit
system setup also prepares the shared regression suite's cloc:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y bash git make curl ca-certificates tar gzip xz-utils perl cloc
```

On macOS, with Xcode Command Line Tools and Homebrew already installed:

```bash
brew install make curl xz cloc
```

macOS supplies Bash, Git (through Command Line Tools), tar, gzip, Perl and shasum.
Homebrew GNU Make is available as `gmake`; use it where the system Make does not
meet a consumer's requirements. These system packages follow the host's package
manager updates; they are not claimed to be checksum-pinned shared binaries.
Shared setup never invokes sudo or installs a package manager implicitly.
The pinned local host set supplies ripgrep; it is not a bootstrap dependency.

Rust repositories separately prepare their declared Rust toolchain, rustfmt and
pinned cargo-sort. Shared Tooling's portable fixtures also require Cargo and
the cargo-sort version in `ci/tool-versions.env`; prepare it explicitly:

```bash
source ci/tool-versions.env
cargo install cargo-sort --version "$SHARED_TOOLING_CARGO_SORT_VERSION" --locked
bash scripts/ci/check-format-tools.sh "$SHARED_TOOLING_CARGO_SORT_VERSION"
```

Before starting portable fixtures, `test-portable-tools.sh` checks the required
commands on PATH (including cloc, shasum, jq, Mike Farah yq and ripgrep) and reuses
the offline formatter check above. Run this admission independently with
`bash scripts/ci/check-portable-prerequisites.sh`. It reports missing commands
together and points back here; it never installs tools or replaces the individual
fixtures' version, feature and behavior checks. Standard Unix utilities from the
bootstrap environment are still required. This is Shared Tooling's own suite
setup, not a new prerequisite gate for every consumer.

ShellCheck, actionlint and Gitleaks use the existing explicit CI installers and
pins; GitHub maintenance needs an installed, authenticated `gh`. Consumer-owned
Node/Rust toolchains, SDKs and product dependencies remain part of that repo's
declared setup. See the [complete script dependency table](supported-hosts.md#tool-specific-dependencies).
